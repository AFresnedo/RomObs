test helpers, views, tests, and controller helpers:

i had some bugs occur because of misunderstanding the nature of helpers...i use
the "test helper" to help me login because i need to fake logins...the sessions
helper is just code for the sessions controller & views that care...i was
trying to use the sessions controller to help my tests which doesn't make any
sense at all (what i needed to use what the sessions controller itself...which
comes from posting to the login_path which THEN uses the sessions helper
methods as intended)... i was trying to look at the view that cared and somehow
emulate/fake an entire session using a session helper and some test
code...completely warped/unintended/wrongful stuff that wasn't following proper
design at all...REALLY just had to login properly (which i wasn't because of
passwords) and then have everything work after that

design error with articles (controller & model):

i created, at the controller level, some code to prevent invalid pages from
being saved but this is done at the wrong level...it is a property of the
article model because it is an attribute of the article model so it should be
a validation in the article model source code instead of being a check in the
controller create

form field / controller / create new errors:
    -in two cases there are auto-fill pages that should be either locked or
    blank

    -article controller new action's form of page needs to be autofilled and/or
    locked

    -comments controller new action's form of both user_id and blog_id needs to
    be autofilled and/or locked

bootstrap:

-replace useless erb with bootstrap
    -erb is used for things like dynamically creating a list based on database
    objects...it is NOT for adding a static picture ffs

-ensure widith=device-width

-containers are not nestable

-use .container when you want to allow containers to the left/right of this one

-else use .container-fluid to be explicit

-specifiying xm/sm,etc just tells it when to automatically (without measuring)
stack the columns...so for user interface design preferences not any mechanical
thing
