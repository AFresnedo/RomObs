blog show doesn't understand article newline, the problem is that whatever is
saved during the form post gets transferred into its symbol form and then when
the body is loaded the only element tags that exist are stuff like <span>
around everything
    -i think mostly the problem is that these helpers aren't very good
    -to clarify, the body has the whitespace intact (you can tell by reading
    the sourcecode when the page is loaded, the whitespace is shown just html
    doesn't care about it when the browser isn't reading the source code...so
    instead of just rendering the erb inserting the body you must process the
    body and then insert it

test helpers, views, tests, and controller helpers:

i had some bugs occur because of misunderstanding the nature of helpers...i use
the "test helper" to help me login because i need to fake logins...the sessions
helper is just code for the sessions controller & views that care...i was
trying to use the sessions controller to help my tests which doesn't make any
sense at all (what i needed to use what the sessions controller itself...which
comes from posting to the login_path which THEN uses the sessions helper
methods as intended)... i was trying to look at the view that cared and somehow
emulate/fake an entire session using a session helper and some test
code...completely warped/unintended/wrongful stuff that wasn't following proper
design at all...REALLY just had to login properly (which i wasn't because of
passwords) and then have everything work after that

design error with articles (controller & model):

i created, at the controller level, some code to prevent invalid pages from
being saved but this is done at the wrong level...it is a property of the
article model because it is an attribute of the article model so it should be
a validation in the article model source code instead of being a check in the
controller create

form field / controller / create new errors:
    -in two cases there are auto-fill pages that should be either locked or
    blank

    -article controller new action's form of page needs to be autofilled and/or
    locked

    -comments controller new action's form of both user_id and blog_id needs to
    be autofilled and/or locked

bootstrap:

-replace useless erb with bootstrap
    -erb is used for things like dynamically creating a list based on database
    objects...it is NOT for adding a static picture ffs

-ensure widith=device-width

-containers are not nestable

-use .container when you want to allow containers to the left/right of this one

-else use .container-fluid to be explicit

-specifiying xm/sm,etc just tells it when to automatically (without measuring)
stack the columns...so for user interface design preferences not any mechanical
thing
