drop-down ui for topics and autofill+hide page field

crud for thought of the day
    -afaik just autofill purpose and page for article creation

add second, but preceeding filter, through a calendar widget that sets the
timeframe of displayed blogs

add created_at, topic index for blogs (also make sure all indexes have
created_at as part of their index if the default scope is set to that)

add author name to blog and replace database hits in index and blogshelper

delete history of articles so, for example, not 1000 thoughts of the day

"fill" (bootstrap) blog index page
    -you are 1920x1080, others aren't

blog index:
    -create a front-end filter to hide results not matching filter (rails will
    still have sent all the blogs to the page via the controller, so filtering
    is done very quickly with no database hits any time it is changed)

blog search:
    -the blog search will probably need to use the database because of tags and
    complexity of algorithms so i think there should be a search controller
    action

website layout/design notes:
    -with the "mode" setting i can have different view modes depending on
    templates chosen by users (user.template = "view_dark")..as long as
    I define everything in the views by arbitrary colors (color1, darkestColor,
    etc) aka make it all templated i can have the values filled in by the
    different templates offered to the user in their settings
        -use the html psuedo-link thing to preview each template by loading up
        the blog or frontpage with the settings in a little window

pages design notes (coupled with article)
    -each article will be a "text object" with a movable/resizeable window and a
     toolbar for text editing like a word processor provides

articles
    -has some form of history and history viewer (maybe last 5)
        -i mean old versions saved to restore
    -unlike blogs, have the text body have a toolbar to pick
    font/color/alignment and other basic text processing features (background,
    etc)

blogs
    -maybe have a simplified toolbar with just bold/italics/underline?
    -archive page with a calendar setup and another search & filter interface
    -tags for referencing for connections? just spew a ton of tags onto each
     blog: president, politics, corruption, police budget, etc etc
      -have tags inputted as: phantom crusaders; corruption; politics
      -tags will be shown in a long string color coded (maybe w/o meaning)
    -topics: fallacies, incoherencies, language, about life, values, power,
    beliefs, power, questions, random observations, almost funny, large and
    small, misc., world, permanent, fleeting, curiosities, public figures,
    periphery, world of ideas, central, intelectual (22 total)

links (sidebar?)

rss feed (sidebar or footer?)

comments
    -will eventually become a nested resource (exclusive to blogs) or a concern
    (used as a nested resource by multiple resources)
    -reference other user & quote (using a well) text

analytics & infographics

admin dashboard
    -seems this is unnecessary, only thing missing atm is analystics&info

forum
    -attached to user account

password reset

security
    -in addition to strong params, ensure userid == current_user when getting
        userid as a param
    -check strong params for all external inputs
    -https
    -cross-server whatever thingy
    -verify no sql injection vulnerabilities

real documentation (of what? not really the calendar)
    -maybe some tips/info about how text objects are setup (purpose?)

pictures & uploads
    -for blogs and articles

cleanup routes

run a scan for TODOs & address until none remaining
